Contains the files to recreate the main text figures. 

TRANSMISSION_SPECTRA_DATA contains the data from each reduction.  

MODEL_FITS contains the best fitting model spectra from each of the four model grids described in the manuscript.
It also contains the "remove one gas at a time" spectra to recreate the top panel of Figure 3.

Wavelength units for the above files are in microns, transit depth is in "absolute" (Rp/Rs)^2 (e.g., not ppm nor percent).

The CSV file contains the data necessary to reproduce the lightcurves shown in Figure 1.
